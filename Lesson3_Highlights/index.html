            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control refers to a central repository that is used for all files of a project which allows users to check out files, edit them, and then check those files back in. Checking files back in is also referred to as committing. Version control acts as an alternative for file sharing. Using version control instead of regular file sharing eliminates problems related to overwriting the work of team members accidentally. Team members can work together at the same time without any problems arising. Version control also makes multiple project versions easily available to you in case you were to need it. This system is great for large projects allowing a team to keep track of all their files and effectively collaborate. However, it is also useful for a single individual who is just looking to have their files backed up.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system, or VCS, takes advantage of the benefits of version control, such as not having to worry about overwriting work, being able to have multiple people work on the same files at the same time, and being able to look back to older versions of your files. A version control system automatically tracks who edited files, when they were edited, and what was edited. Version control systems consist of local and remote repositories. The local repository is the individual machine while the remote repository is a separate server for the shared files. This is useful for something like web app development as it can be hard to keep track of everything when there are a lot of files and a lot of people using those files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local vs Remote Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is one that exists on a user's end, or on their own "local" machine. A local repository can be created brand new from the user, or it can be duplicated or cloned from a remote repository onto your local machine. A remote repository is one that exists on a remote server which is separate from the user's machine. The remote repository is likely shared between many people working on a project together. Transferring edits from a local repository to a remote repository is what is known as a "push", with the command for this being "$ git push". This is interesting as I've understood the use of local and remote servers but haven't personally experienced using any program that takes advantage of this.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system. It allows for users to have a copy of the remote files. Some commands include git init, git add, git commit, git log, and git status. Add, commit, and push are the three basic steps. The add command tells Git to acknowledge the files that you tell it to. Commit tells Git to take a "snapshot" of the repository. Push uploads local commits to remote repositories. Git is great as it is both a free and open source version control system. It allows users to easily collaborate and have their files backed up.

                <span class="text-muted">Other Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To initialize a repository you can use the command git init. To pull the edits that were made from a remote repository to a local one, you can use the command git pull. The status command allows you to see the files that were edited since the last time it was backed up as well as files that were added to be committed. The diff command finds conflicts or differences between files. git clone creates a copy from a remote source. Git config sets values for different things, such as the user's name, file formats, among other settings. It can be helpful to know these different commands so that you are able to use Git with ease.</p>
